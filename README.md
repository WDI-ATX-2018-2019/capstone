Journal

The goal of this project is to create a single page webapp that provides functionality for users as a daily journal. 

The initial landing page will provide a sign in page for users, connecting them to a database after authentication, and allow them to update their journal, and see previous journal entries. Past journal entries will allow users to edit, and delete as they see necessary. 

Front end will be styled via React, and some CSS library integration, with postgresql providing the database for users and user entries.
